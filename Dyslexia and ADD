# Lesson Builder Rules (Dyslexia + ADHD–Friendly)

App goal:  
Take a **concept / URL / pasted text** and turn it into a **short, structured, multisensory lesson** that works well for learners with **dyslexia and ADHD**.

---

## 1. Core Learning Principles

The app should **always** try to:

1. **Reduce cognitive load**
   - Short chunks
   - Simple language
   - Minimal clutter

2. **Use multiple senses**
   - See (text, diagrams, color)
   - Hear (audio / TTS)
   - Say (prompts to explain out loud)
   - Do (small actions like drag, select, reorder)

3. **Externalize memory**
   - Visible steps, checklists, and summaries
   - Auto-generated “cheat sheets”

4. **Support ADHD attention patterns**
   - Short “missions”
   - Clear start/finish
   - Built-in timers or suggested time boxes

---

## 2. Lesson Structure Overview

For any input (concept / URL / text), the app should create a lesson with these stages:

1. **Preview** – Get the gist and the map  
2. **Chunking** – Break into small, labeled sections  
3. **Active Processing** – Turn content into user’s own words + visuals  
4. **Teach-Back** – Prompt user to explain it  
5. **Smart Review** – Generate quick review prompts for later

Each stage below has implementation rules.

---

## 3. Stage 1: Preview

**Goal:** Give the learner a fast “map” of the idea before details.

When the app ingests content:

- Extract:
  - Title / main heading
  - Subheadings
  - Key terms (bold/italic/definitions)
- Generate:
  - **One-sentence “big idea”** in simple language
  - **2–3 guiding questions**, e.g.:
    - “What is this concept?”
    - “Why does it matter?”
    - “What are its main parts?”

**Lesson UI:**

- Show:
  - “Big Idea” (1 sentence)
  - 2–3 questions as bullets
- Optional:
  - “This lesson will take about X minutes” (keep short)

---

## 4. Stage 2: Chunking

**Goal:** Turn long text into small, manageable pieces.

Rules:

- Split the content into **3–7 chunks**:
  - Intro / overview
  - 1–5 core sections
  - Summary / wrap-up
- Each chunk should:
  - Have a short, clear **chunk title** (max ~5–7 words)
  - Aim for **short paragraphs** (or bullet points)
- Mark each chunk as a **mini mission**:
  - e.g., “Chunk 2 of 5: How X causes Y”

**Lesson UI:**

- Display chunks as steps:
  - Step 1, Step 2, Step 3…
- Let user see **overall progress** (e.g., “Step 2 of 5”).

---

## 5. Stage 3: Active Processing (Per Chunk)

**Goal:** Help the learner DO something with the content so it sticks.

For each chunk, the app should:

### 3.1 Multisensory Delivery

- Provide **text view** in a dyslexia-friendly style:
  - Simple font (e.g., Arial, Lexend)
  - Larger font size and line spacing
- Offer **audio**:
  - Text-to-speech for the chunk
  - Button: “Listen to this section”

### 3.2 Simple Summary Prompt

After the user reads/listens:

- Generate and show a **1–2 sentence auto-summary**
- Then prompt the user:

> “In **your own words**, what is the one main point of this section?”

- Let them respond via:
  - Text input **or**
  - Voice (speech-to-text)

### 3.3 “3 Bullet” Extraction

Prompt:

> “Write **3 short bullets** that capture the most important ideas from this section.”

- Provide an **AI-suggested 3-bullet draft** they can:
  - Accept
  - Edit
  - Rewrite

### 3.4 Quick Visual Hook

For each chunk, auto-generate **one simple visual representation**, such as:

- A mini **diagram** (e.g., A → B → C)
- A **mind map** style list
- A **comparison table** (if applicable)

UI idea:

- Show a simple, auto-generated diagram
- Add a prompt:

> “If you had to draw this on a napkin, how would you draw it?”

(Users don’t *have* to draw, but the mental image helps.)

---

## 6. Stage 4: Teach-Back

**Goal:** Check understanding by having the learner explain the concept.

After all chunks are processed:

- Show a simple outline of all chunks:
  - Chunk titles
  - The learner’s own summaries/bullets

Then prompt:

> “Without looking at the original text, explain this whole concept to:
> - a 12-year-old
> - or a busy coworker in 1–2 minutes.”

Options:

- **Voice note** (preferred)
- Text input

The app can:

- Auto-summarize their explanation
- Highlight:
  - What they covered well
  - What key idea(s) might be missing

---

## 7. Stage 5: Smart Review

**Goal:** Make it easy to revisit without rereading everything.

From the processed lesson, the app should auto-generate:

1. **One-page “Cheat Sheet”**
   - Title of concept
   - Big idea (1–2 sentences)
   - 3–7 key bullets
   - 1 simple diagram or relationship map
   - 1 concrete example

2. **Quick Review Prompts**
   - 3–5 question cards, e.g.:
     - “What is this concept and why does it matter?”
     - “Name the 3 most important points.”
     - “Explain it in one sentence.”
   - Optionally: basic quiz (multiple choice / true-false / fill-in)

3. **Suggested Review Schedule**
   - Same day: “Review your cheat sheet tonight (2–5 min)”
   - Next day: “Test yourself with 3 questions”
   - Few days later: “Redraw the diagram from memory”

(Implementation of reminders can be handled by the app, but spec should support **spacing**.)

---

## 8. Dyslexia & ADHD–Friendly Defaults

Where possible, the app should adopt these defaults:

- **Visual design**
  - Clean layout, lots of white space
  - Short paragraphs and bullet lists
  - No huge walls of text

- **Language**
  - Short sentences
  - Minimal jargon
  - Define any necessary jargon clearly

- **Interaction**
  - Many small steps instead of few big ones
  - Clear labels: “Start,” “Next,” “Done”
  - Always show progress (“Step 3 of 5”)

- **Accessibility**
  - Audio button on every text block
  - Dictation option for all open-ended responses

---

## 9. Lesson Generation Pipeline (Developer Summary)

1. **Input**
   - Concept string **or**
   - URL (HTML) **or**
   - Raw text

2. **Processing**
   - Extract structure (headings, sections, key terms)
   - Summarize: big idea + main sections
   - Chunk into 3–7 sections
   - For each chunk:
     - Summarize
     - Generate bullets
     - Generate simple visual structure
   - Aggregate into:
     - Cheat sheet
     - Review questions

3. **Outputs for UI**
   - `preview`: big idea, questions
   - `chunks[]`: title, text, AI summary, AI bullets, audio source, visual representation
   - `teach_back_prompts[]`
   - `cheat_sheet`
   - `review_questions[]`
   - `suggested_review_schedule`

---

## 10. Future Ideas (Optional)

- “Fun modes”:
  - Explain concept as a story, comic, or analogy
- Difficulty levels:
  - Beginner (very simple language + fewer details)
  - Standard (normal detail)
  - Deep dive (advanced users)

These should still follow the same **Preview → Chunk → Process → Teach → Review** flow.
